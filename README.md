# odin-calculator

Create and test functions to to perform the following basic math operators: add, subtract, multiply, divide.

Declare three variables e.g(3 + 2). Variables will be used to update project display later.

Buttons will be displayed

If the user presses a button
  *Obtain the value of the button
  *Store the value in the declared variables
  *Perform the math operation using the selected user's operator when the user presses the 'equal' button.

Create the calculator display for the clear button.

If a user inputs more than a pair of numbers and a second operator
  * The first pair will be calculated 
  * Display the calculated value first after the user presses the second operator 
  * The value displayed will be used as a first variable for the second math operation along with the operator.

The calculated value will have its decimal rounded off.

While the user has less than 2 numbers and an operator, disable the '=' button.

If the user presses the clear button
  * All existing data will be 'deleted' causing the user to start over.

If the user tries to divide by 0
  * Prevent the operation
  * Display an error message
